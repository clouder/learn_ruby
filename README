My fork of learn_ruby with the solutions I came up with

Solving these problems to help me refresh what I know in ruby and also to
hopefully become a better ruby programmer.  Upon forking the git repo I am now
hoping to become a little more proficient in git.

If anyone other than myself finds this useful that'd be awesome :)
If anyone wants to offer ideas or improvements to the solutions I already have
that would be even more awesome :D
